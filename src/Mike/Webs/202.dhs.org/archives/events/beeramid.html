    that means drinking, too]</small></font><p><strong><font face="Arial">How Much?&nbsp; $10.
    &nbsp; Covers the cost of beer, brats, and anything else needed.&nbsp; If you don't want
    to drink beer or don't want brats, you can give whatever you think you should, though $5
    would be easiest.&nbsp; </font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial">What you need to do:&nbsp; click <a href="beersurvey.html">here</a>
    to fill out a short survey, and give Mike $ before Saturday.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial"><em>History</em>: Last year on May 2nd, the Fab Four built a
    majority of the beeramid on the left.&nbsp; This year we want to make a bigger better
    beeramid.&nbsp; Last years had a nine can base, we have to at least make an 11 can base.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial">On Saturday May 1st, we will start the evening early with a
    brat cookout on one of the grills outside Turner.&nbsp; After eating the beer brats (yes,
    they will be real beer brats), we will continue inside for the beeramid building.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial">What is significant about that particular Saturday?&nbsp; It
    is the last weekend night before 21 hour quiet hours are in effect.&nbsp; Therefore, it is
    the <blink>LAST</blink> official party night in 202 Turner.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial">There will be a charge for beeramid night to pay for brats,
    buns, beer, and briquettes.&nbsp; It will probably be $5 to $10.&nbsp; Next weeks 202 News
    will have more details.&nbsp; Please have the money by next Thursday, April 29th <em>[I'd
    like the money ahead of time to be able to buy stuff with everyone's money and know about
    how many people will come.]</em></font></strong></p></td>
