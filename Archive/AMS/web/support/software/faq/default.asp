<h3><b>About</b></h3>
<p>
<a name="a1"><b>Q: What is Adult Media Swapper (AMS)?</b></a><br>
A: AMS is an adult media sharing program. Thousands of people who have downloaded AMS share their adult media library with the rest of the world. We keep a master list that allows anyone to search for the specific media they are interested in. <br><br>
</p><br>


<h3><b>General Questions</b></h3>
<p>
<a name="g1"><b>Q: Does AMS store any media?</b></a><br>
A: AMS does not store any media on our servers. All media is stored by people who have downloaded the client and shared their media database using AMS.<br><br>

<a name="g2"><b>Q: Why does it take so long to run a search?</b></a><br>
A: If your search is extremely narrow and complex it may take some time for our servers to find matching media among the millions of entries in our database. Also, if you are searching during peak times (4PM – 12PM Central time) our servers may be backlogged with requests. We are doing our best to upgrade our servers to meet the demand.<br><br>

<a name="g3"><b>Q: Why does it take so long for some images to download?</b></a><br>
A: Every image is stored on someone’s personal computer. If the person who has your image is using a slow dial up connection, or has a large media library, it may take some time to download.<br><br>

<a name="g4"><b>Q: I’m looking for a piece of media I found before. When I do an identical search, the file doesn’t appear. Why?</b></a><br>
A: This is intentional. We randomize the search results so that each search returns unique media. Also, the person who is hosting the file may not be online, or may have taken that file off of his/her computer.<br><br>

<a name="g5"><b>Q: When I do a search, no results are returned.</b></a><br>
A: This can be for one of three reasons: <br><br>

</p><ul><li><b>There are matching images, but the server hasn't run across them yet.</b><br>
The server will search through several hundred random pictures to try and find your matches. The server does not search the entire database each time. This prevents one narrowly defined search from taking up all of the server's resources. If you click the magnifying glass a few more times, the server may run across some matching results.</li><li><b>There are matching images, but the person sharing them isn't online.</b><br>
The server keeps a list of everyone who is sharing a particular image. If that image matches your search, but no one is sharing it currently, the server won't return that result. If you try your search again at a different time you may get additional results.</li><li><b>There are no matching images.</b><br>
AMS is a new program and all possible search combinations haven't been indexed yet. If you wait a few days or weeks and run your search again you may get additional results.</li></ul><p>

<a name="g5a"><b>Q: When I do a search, few results are returned and it keeps returning the same ones.</b><br>
A: The server has searched through its entire database, and those were the only matches currently being shared. Please read the previous question for additional information.<br><br>

<a name="g6"><b>Q: Is my privacy protected?</b><br>
A: AMS does not share or sell its mailing list to anyone. You may receive e-mail from our partners if you selected to participate in the mailing lists when you signed up. In addition we do not keep individual statistics on searches, etc. Statistics are only used for large-scale things (1.2 million searches for breasts=small per day, etc.) Please see our <a href="../../../about/privacy/default.asp">privacy policy</a> in the about section for more detail.<br><br>

<a name="g7"><b>Q: Is my hard drive secure? Is AMS secure?</b></a><br>
A: AMS shares only the files you download using AMS, or files you specifically tell it to. Any files stored outside of those shared folders/files are secure from the AMS program. This does not mean that your computer is secure, however. If your Internet or network settings are incorrectly set up, hackers could access your computer regardless of whether you have AMS installed or not. Your best bet is to invest in some firewall software. We recommend using <a href="http://www.tinysoftware.com/pwall.php">Tiny Software's personal firewall</a>.<br><br>

<a name="g8"><b>Q: I have kids who use my computer, is there anyway to lock the program so they can’t get at it?</b></a><br>
A: While the program can be password protected, it is by no means secure. If you are worried about anyone finding the application or media, our advice is to uninstall the program. The password protection can be found in the options menu. For more information on securing the program, please see the online manual.<br><br>

<a name="g9"><b>Q: I have a fetish that isn’t listed, or an idea for some new search terms. Who can I tell?</b></a><br>
A: Please add your idea to the suggestions page. We rely on our end users to help shape AMS into a quality product.<br><br>

<a name="g10"><b>Q: I’m the owner of an adult site. Can I place some pictures on AMS for free advertising?</b></a><br>
A: Absolutely! The only rule you should follow is to make sure the picture you’re posting contains adult-oriented images. If you’re just posting a banner with your web address, don’t bother. If you’re posting a sample picture with your banner on the bottom of it, go right ahead!<br><br>

Remember to accurately index the sample picture(s) you share. This will give your pictures the best exposure to potential customers.<br><br>

<a name="g11"><b>Q: I found some of the search terms or media returned to be offensive. What are you going to do to get my panties out of a bunch?</b></a><br>
A: Grow up… We made it quite clear when you downloaded the program that there may be offensive things there. If you can’t stand it, then uninstall the program.<br><br><br>



<h3><b>Issues / Common Problems</b></h3>
<p>
<a name="p1"><b>Q: When I double click on a thumbnail, it doesn’t get moved into my download queue.</b></a><br>
A: This could be several things: You have a really fast connection (the picture gets downloaded before the application can show it in the queue), You already have the picture in your collection (the application is smart enough to not waste bandwidth by downloading it again), or you might be looking at your upload queue by mistake.<br><br>

<a name="p2"><b>Q: My pictures show up with "not shared" under them. How do I get these pictures to be shared?</b></a><br>
A: If you exit the application and login again, the pictures should now be shared.<br><br>
</p><br>


<h3><b>Technical</b></h3>
<p>
<a name="t1"><b>Q: I’m an administrator and need to block AMS from our company. How would I go about doing this?</b></a><br>
A: Please see the <a href="../techinfo/default.asp">technical specifications</a> for information on port numbers and IP addresses to block.<br><br>
</p><br>



<h3><b>Copyright / Legality / Misindexed Media</b></h3>
<p>
<a name="c1"><b>Q: I’m an artist, photographer, or company who sees some of my copyrighted material being shared illegally. What can I do to stop it?</b></a><br>
A: See our <a href="../../copyright/default.asp">copyright</a> section for steps you can take to protect your work.<br><br>

We are in the process of automating our filtering system. This will allow copyright holders to submit their pictures to a secure web site. These pictures are then added to our filtering list and deleted.<br><br>

<a name="c2"><b>Q: My search returned some media that is obviously illegal. Are these files now saved to my system? What can I do to help stop these files from being distributed?</b></a><br>
A: In order to save a file, you must first add it to your download queue and then click ‘save’ in the completed downloads section. If you did not do both of these steps, the image has not been saved to your computer.<br><br>

We are in the process of upgrading the AMS client to provide suspicious file tracking. In the future, you will be able to mark a file as suspicious. These files will be reviewed by our staff and removed if necessary.<br><br>

<a name="c3"><b>Q: I downloaded some files that obviously don’t match what I searched for. How can I prevent this?</b></a><br>
A: We rely on end users to index media correctly. Unfortunately, we have no control over how our users index each piece of media.<br><br>

We are currently working hard to correct this problem. We spot check newly indexed media to find accounts that habitually misindex files. When found, we put these accounts in “untrusted” mode and any future indexing from them is ignored by our system. We are also working on upgrading the AMS client to include client side marking of misindexed files. Any files you find misindexed, you can report with a simple click of the mouse. Our staff will review the media and remove/reindex it if necessary.<br><br>

<a name="c4"><b>Q: What is to stop me from incorrectly indexing files just to screw up other people.</b></a><br>
A: Absolutely nothing. We are reliant on end users to correctly index files. If enough people flag a file as incorrectly indexed, we will take steps to remove it from our database, or revoke user accounts as needed.<br><br>
