Splash.exe - small (3.5k), simple (one file) program that lets you throw 
up a splash screen in NSIS installers.

To use:

Create a .BMP file of your splash screen.

Add the following lines to your .NSI file:


Function .onInit
  SetOutPath $TEMP
  File /oname=spltmp.dat "my_splash.bmp"
  File /oname=spltmp.exe "C:\program files\nsis\splash.exe"
  ExecWait '"$TEMP\spltmp.exe" 1000 $HWNDPARENT spltmp.dat'
  Delete $TEMP\spltmp.exe
  Delete $TEMP\spltmp.dat
FunctionEnd

Note that the first parameter to splash.exe is the length to show the
screen for (in milliseconds), the second is the parent window (in decimal), 
and the last is the splash bitmap filename.

(If you already have an .onInit function, put that in it)

Note: the return value of splash.exe is 1 if the user closed the splash 
screen early (you can check it using ClearErrors/IfErrors)
