<h3>Support</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, we can not offer individual support for AMS at this time. AMS is a free product and our 
advertising doesn't even cover our bandwidth costs. We have put together a searchable knowledge base in the 
<a href="software/">Software Support</a> section, as well as some useful information in the frequently asked questions.
</p>

<p>
If you can not find the solution to your problem in the knowledge base, you can submit a description of your 
problem to us. If enough users are encountering the same problem, we will research a fix and post it in the knowledge base.
