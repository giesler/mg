<h3>Indexing Instructions:</h3>

<p>This indexing tutorial is to help our users accurately index and categorize files within Adult Media Swapper.</p>

<p>Adult Media Swapper uses human entered indexes to perform all of its searching. The more accurate and complete 
these indexes are, the higher quality and more frequent the results are.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, the categories and indexes we choose are not an exhaustive list of all possible. Rather, it is 
a balance between grinding our servers to a halt with complicated searches and having the most popular features 
listed. If you have any suggestions for additional categories, please submit them to the 
<a href="../suggest/">suggestions</a> page.</p>

<p><b>Basic Indexing Rules:</b><ol>
<li>Don’t fill in anything for attributes you can’t see. If you can’t see their butt, don’t check anything in the butt category.</li>
<li>Judge each picture in a series individually. You may know the person in the picture has medium breasts, but if they are laying down and the breasts look small, check the small box. Remember, other people may only see this one picture, and not the rest of the series.</li></ol></p>
