<h3>What is AMS?</h3> 

<p>
Adult Media Swapper is a peer-to-peer file-sharing program specifically tailored for adult media. AMS 
connects you to thousands of other people who have an interest browsing and collecting adult media. Using its advanced searching capabilities, you can 
quickly and easily locate media of your tastes. Best of all, you can use AMS for FREE!
</p>

<p>
Adult Media Swapper does not store any media on our servers. AMS is simply a file sharing and searching 
application that connects you directly to other users. AMS does NOT control the content you may find using this tool. Please see our acceptable use policy for 
more information.
</p>

<p>
When you perform a search in AMS, our servers will find media that matches your search criteria. The servers will 
then return the location of matching files to your AMS application. Your AMS application will then directly contact the computer storing the file. The AMS 
application is also a full-featured media management system. It allows you to index, search, and view your stored media all from its advanced interface.
