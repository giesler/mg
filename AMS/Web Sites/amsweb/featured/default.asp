						As long as we are reviewing teen sites, we might as well add a hardcore one to 
						the mix. Freshteen has everything you could possibly imagine: hardcore sex, 
						blowjobs galore, girl on girl action, tons of movies, weird fetish stuff, and 
						more of it then any site I’ve ever seen. (You need to check out their dildo cam 
						– it’s a tiny camera inside of a plastic dildo.)
					</p>
					<p>
						They claim to have over 150,000 pictures, 45,000 videos, adult jokes and games, 
						sex chat, animated cartoons and much more. While I didn’t count the pictures 
						and movies to verify, the four days I spent reviewing this site didn’t even 
						scratch the surface of what they have to offer.
					</p>
					<p>
						The interface is deceptively sparse. The member’s page is first broken into 
						major categories (movies, pictures, jokes, toons, cams, etc.) Each category 
						then has its own page with a detailed breakdown of its content. It wasn’t 
						unusual for this to continue twelve or more levels deep. After a few hours of 
						surfing you gain an appreciation of its size and depth.The last comment I have 
						to make is about their movies. We aren’t talking about a bunch of .mpgs sitting 
						in a directory for you to grab. Each set of movies are categorized and have 
						their own custom interface. No two galleries are alike.
					</p>
					<p>
						If I had to find a complaint with this site, it would be that their interface 
						is too rich. Anyone with a dialup connection will spend a lot of time waiting 
						for buttons and borders to load before any pictures/movies appear. Then again, 
						if you are looking for movies, chances are you have cable or DSL. If you do 
						have a broadband connection, you’re in for a treat!

						Mosteroticteens has a huge assortment of quality teen media. The majority of 
						their six gigabytes worth of content is original. They have pictures (~20,000), 
						movies (~200), and live webcams (3 channels) all included with a membership. 
						The focus is on softcore erotic photography, but they do have hardcore movies 
						and plenty of girl on girl media. Their interface is a little odd, but their 
						site is well designed and the photography breathtaking. Hardcore fans will be 
						disappointed, as the membership price isn’t worth the few pieces of hardcore 
						media they have available. If you’re a softcore teen fan, it doesn’t get any 
						better then this.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Here is a hint:</b> When you’re done going through their tour, go back to 
						the main page, click on the webmasters link at the bottom, then click on the 
						promo content link at the top for lots of free sample pictures.
