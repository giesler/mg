		<h4>
			There are some rules to this contest:
		</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					You must have a valid e-mail address to win. If we can’t contact you, the prize 
					will go to the runner-up. Check your <a href="../account/">Account Information</a>
					to verify the e-mail address that we have on record.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Indexes must be accurate.</b> We screen all of the indexes and will 
					disqualify anyone who is inaccurately describing pictures. Be sure to read the <a href="../support/software/indexing/">
						Indexing FAQ</a> for details on how to correctly index files.</li>
				<li>
					Each person you refer must sign up using a unique IP address, have a valid 
					e-mail address, and sign on to AMS at least once before points are credited to 
					your account.</li>
				<li>
					This contest is only open to users in the United States or Canada. We will not 
					ship any prizes outside of this area.</li>
				<li>
					The contest ends on midnight, Central time, on the last day of the month.</li>
				<li>
					You have one week to respond to our e-mail to claim your prize. We send out 
					e-mail to the winners within two business days after the contest has ended to 
					give us time to verify indexing accuracy.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>
			Contest Tips:
		</h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Make sure anyone you refer is using your correct e-mail address when signing 
					up. Check your <a href="../account/">Account Information</a> to verify the 
					e-mail address that we have on record.</li>
				<li>
					To get the most points possible, make sure you index each picture as completely 
					as possible. Scoring is done on a weighted curve, meaning you’ll get more 
					points for indexing one picture completely then by indexing three pictures 
					partially.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Be accurate!</b> Read the <a href="../support/software/indexing/">Indexing FAQ</a>
					first to get an understanding of how to index files properly. If in doubt, 
					error on the side of caution. You don’t want to get inadvertently disqualified 
					for some simple mistakes.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>
			Scoring:
		</h4>
		<p>
			Scoring for referrals is simple: For each friend you sign up (using your e-mail 
			address as the referrer), you'll earn 100 points. You can earn a maximum of 
			1,000 points using this method. Be sure to read the rules for additional 
			details.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scoring for the indexing is done on a weighted curve, meaning you’ll get more 
			points for indexing one picture completely then by indexing three pictures 
			partially. The actual formula used to score each picture is listed below, but 
			the graph is much easier to interpret:
		</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img src="contest_graph.jpg">
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="483">
					<p>
						<i>From this graph you can see that minimally indexing many pictures is not nearly 
							as effective as completely indexing fewer pictures.</i>
					</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			The scoring formula is: X=Y^(1.2+.01*Y) where Y is the number of unique fields 
			indexed (22 maximum.) Categories are calculated separately and added to the 
			fields score above. Categories are simply: 10 points for the first category, 5 
			for the second category, and one point for each category there after. Note that 
			in the above graph the points for category indexes are not shown.
		</p>
