					Information</a> to verify the e-mail address that we have on record.</li> <b>

			</ol>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>
			Contest Tips:
		</h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					To get the most points possible, make sure you index each picture as completely 
					as possible. Scoring is done on a weighted curve, meaning you’ll get more 
					points for indexing one picture completely then by indexing three pictures 
					partially.</li>
				<li>
					<b>Be accurate!</b> Read the <a href="../support/software/indexing/">Indexing FAQ</a>
					first to get an understanding of how to index files properly. If in doubt, 
					error on the side of caution. You don’t want to get inadvertently disqualified 
					for some simple mistakes.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>
			Scoring:
		</h4>
		<p>
			Scoring is done on a weighted curve, meaning you’ll get more points for 
			indexing one picture completely then by indexing three pictures partially. The 
			actual formula used to score each picture is listed below, but the graph is 
			much easier to interpret:
		</p>
		<table border="0">
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img src="../img/contest_graph.jpg">
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="483">
					<p>
						<i>From this graph you can see that minimally indexing many pictures is not nearly 
							as effective as completely indexing fewer pictures.</i>
					</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			The scoring formula is: X=Y^(1.2+.01*Y) where Y is the number of unique fields 
			indexed (22 maximum.) Categories are calculated separately and added to the 
			fields score above. Categories are simply: 10 points for the first category, 5 
			for the second category, and one point for each category there after. Note that 
			in the above graph the points for category indexes are not shown.
		</p>
