<h3>Copyright Protection</h3>
 
<p>
AMS is serious about protecting the work of artists and companies. We are in the process of adding copyright 
protection into AMS for the version 1.0 release.
</p>

<p>
When we are finished, this copyright page will allow you to submit images of copyright work into our 
filter. Once we have reviewed your registration, we will assign you an FTP directory and account. Any media uploaded into that directory will be added to 
our filters on a nightly basis. If you do not wish to upload your pictures, you will also be able to download a small program that will general checksums (IDs) 
of any copyrighted work that can be manually added to our filter page.
