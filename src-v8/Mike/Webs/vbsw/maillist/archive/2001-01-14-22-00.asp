<h3>VB Setup Wrapper 2.00</h3>

<p>
Version 2.00 of VBSW is now available!  It took some time, 
but should be worth the wait.  Read on for more information.
</p>

<h4>What's New in 2.00</h4>

<p>
Version 2.00 is a significant upgrade.<br>
<ul>
	<li>The 'Autorun' dialog now resizes to whatever BMP image you specify</li>
	<li>You can specify button images for the 'Install' button and the 'Cancel' button</li>
	<li>You can decide exactly what version of system files you would like checked on the target computer</li>
	<li>You can <b>add</b> other system components not included in the default list via an easy to use 'Settings Utility', and components can 'depend' on other components being installed.</li>
	<li>Using the 'Settings Utility' you can specify all the program options you should need</li>
	<li>During installation of system components, the dialog is now fully responsive to user interaction, and even has a 'Cancel' button that will cancel installation when the currently installing component completes installation.</li>
	<li>If the computer needs to be restarted, a dialog with a 15 second timeout is displayed, then the system can automatically restart</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Help!</h4>

<p>
I'd really appreciate feedback on this release.  I am also close to being able to localize this program for other languages, 
but will need volunteers to do translation.  Let me know by replying to this message, or visiting the 'Feedback' area of the 
website.
